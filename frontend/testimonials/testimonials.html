          <p>We had a New Years fellowship with our family, and in the end we did New Year's Resolution.
            My youngest son, Carlos was very emotional and said that he wants to rescue a dog this year. 
            As a mom, I saw his warm heart and wanted to help him out. I found Patties Angels, but was
            skeptical about shelters so I was worried. We went there as a family and the atmosphere was
            so loving and warm. Pattie was very helpful, and the animals there were taken care of a lot. 
            Charles was found on the road, limping with a broken leg and Pattie saved him.

      <p>I never thought that I would rescue an animal. I was always skeptical of shelters
        and did not want to step a foot into one. One day, I was walking by Patties Angels 
        and she approached me to look at some animals that she had avaliable. I was free at 
        that time and said to myself "why not?" Once I stepped into that place and saw those 
        gorgeous animals, my heart melted. At that moment I realized I have to walk out from here
        with a pet. Pattie was super nice and showed me Jenna and said "this one will be there for you all the time."
        Guess what??? Jenna is my bestfriend now. I recommend this place, it is very clean and people there
        actually care about these animals. Jenna was once dropped off at the shelter in a bad condition,
        where Pattie had to do everything she can to save her.

  <p>This was an experience of a LIFE TIME!!! Covid hit and I was feeling 
    very separated from the world but I wanted to do a good deed. Since a kid I wanted to have a dog pet. 
    I had an idea to rescue a pet, where I went to look for local shelters in my area. Here I found Patties Angels,
    the owner was amazing. She was super happy to see me and helped me find the dog that was a good fit for me. Frankie is awesome. 
    Frankie had a terrible story where he got hit by a car and was just left on the side of road.
    Out of no where, Pattie was driving home and saw Frankie. She quickly rushed him to the shelter, 
    and saved his life.
